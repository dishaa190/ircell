            <p>Are you a student looking for ways to earn money online? Then you are at the right place. Being a student
                is a crucial phase of a persons life and also the time
                when you are financially dependent on your parents. Today, with the advent of the internet, there are
                ample opportunities
                for students to make money online. Unlike the traditional methods of working part-time as a student,
                where you need to be physically present, now you can earn additional income from the comfort of your
                home online.

                How to Earn Money Online for Students in India?


                Working part-time as a student gives you the opportunity to experience corporate life and helps you
                choose your career, which you might want to pursue later.
                As per Glassdoors report, the average pay of a student is â‚¹25000/month in India.

                If you have a zeal for writing, then blogging is something you can do in your spare time. You can write
                on topics related to academics or
                something that interests you and you have good knowledge about. To get started, follow the steps below:
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Choose a domain name</li>
                <li>Register your blog with a domain registration company</li>
                <li>Get your blog designed</li>
                <li>Purchase a hosting service</li>
                <li>Monetize your blog</li>
            </ul>


            You can also start blogging for free on websites like WordPress and Blogger. Once you have a good amount of
            traffic
            on your blog, you can start monetizing it. A few ways to do it are as follows:

            With advertising networks like Google Adsense
            Affiliate networks
            In-text advertising
            Starting an online store
            And selling your own blog space
            It would be an advantage if you could also learn SEO skills. SEO lets you get more visibility in search
            engines
            whenever someone searches for the content you write and therefore helps bring more ads to your page,
            eventually increasing your earnings.
